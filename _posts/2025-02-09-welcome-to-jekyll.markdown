This post introduces web application that I developed for my senior project. 

### Backgrounds ###
I chose to develop a task management application for two main reasons.

## From a Learning Perspective ##
The task management application is simple in functionality, yet it comprehensively covers the fundamental components required for real-world application development (such as backend CRUD operations, frontend form handling, and database integration). This made it an ideal project with a realistic level of difficulty that matched my current skill set. Although I had other options, such as a note-taking app, an app with posting features, or a schedule management app, I ultimately chose to develop a task management app because of the second reason.

## Based on Real-Life Demand and Personal Experience ##
At this university, I often heard that students were either pursuing double majors or facing a heavy load of assignments. I, too, frequently struggled with managing my tasks and assignments. Given this background, I felt there was a need for a tool to help organize personal tasks and assignments, and I wanted to create an application that could assist students in managing their daily workload.
